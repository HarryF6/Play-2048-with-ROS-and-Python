# 2048
2048 game with ROS and OpenCV

The code interactively plays 2048 through ROS and OpenCV. This practice consists of making a "bot" that is capable of playing a game relatively simple using the vision tools seen in the subject. It will be necessary to make use INTENSIVE ROS for the different parts of capture, processing and execution of the actions. Ideally we should make a structure that would serve us for any game with a board structure with cells and that you have to make some kind of interaction with the cells.
